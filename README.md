# TuneMatcher

TuneMatcher is a simple tool for prototyping interaction to detect whether the user has played the right tune. TuneMatcher takes the user played tune as an input and matches the sound of the tune with the orginal tune from the webserver. If the match is successful, it gives a green light and happy sound output. If the match is unsuccessful, it gives red light and unhappy sound as output.

# Storyboard

Traditionally, a guitar learner would have to find a tutor to coach them to play guitar. However, best tutors are not always accessible. Moreover, tutors are expensive and not flexible with time.

Guitar learners, who seek flexibility and convenience, resort to YouTube tutorials. However, YouTube tutorials are not personalized.

Introducing TuneMatcher! It not only shows you what notes to play at what point in time but also gives live feedback by matching the tunes that the guitar learner plays with the original tune.
