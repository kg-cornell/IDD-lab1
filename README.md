# TuneMatcher

TuneMatcher is a simple tool for prototyping interaction to detect whether the user has played the right tune. TuneMatcher takes the user played tune as an input and matches the sound of the tune with the orginal tune from the webserver. If the match is successful, it gives a green light and happy sound output. If the match is unsuccessful, it gives red light and unhappy sound as output.

# Storyboard

Traditionally, a guitar learner would have to find a tutor to coach them to play guitar. However, best tutors are not always accessible. Moreover, tutors are expensive and not flexible with time.

Guitar learners, who seek flexibility and convenience, resort to YouTube tutorials. However, YouTube tutorials are not personalized.

Introducing TuneMatcher! It not only shows you what notes to play at what point in time but also gives live feedback by matching the tunes that the guitar learner plays with the original tune.

# Act out the Interaction

The interaction was enacted by using Tinkerbelle on laptop and phone. The phone was held by proxy guitar coach. The porxy coach turned the light green and played happy tune when the tune played on guitar was correct, and turned the light red and played unhappy tune when the tune on the guitar was incorrect.

# Prototype

A prototype was created using Matchering 2.0 GitHub code. The code takes in 2 inputs - tune played by the guitar learner and original tune - and gives an output of whether the both the tunes match.

# Record the interaction
